### 2024.4.4 MaxEB

> Understandably, there is a lot of hype around MaxEB due to its capability to cap/reduce validator sizes, decrease network messages, and save bandwidth for solo stakers. However, people tend to overlook EIP-7549: Move committee index outside Attestation
>
> Which achieves similar benefits without necessitating validator consolidation. Assuming perfect aggregation and a 1M validator 64-committee size, we can observe a reduction from 18KB to 4KB
>
> Both solutions will coexist and complement each other, but it's essential not to underestimate the advantages of having a superior attestation aggregation structure. See @mkalinin2's notes for more detail:
