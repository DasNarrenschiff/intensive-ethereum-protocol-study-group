[Hello，my name is Wenbo and I'm a undergraduate student who loves BlockChain and Deeplearning. I'm looking forward to learning about the Ethereum Protocol by attending intensive-study-group.ヾ(≧▽≦*)o]

## Notes

### 2024.4.6
1. As hinted above, the main high level components of Ethereum are execution and consensus layer. These are 2 networks which are connected and dependent on each other.
如上所述，以太坊的主要高级组件是执行层和共识层。这是两个相互连接且相互依赖的网络。
2. Execution layer provides the execution engine, handles user transaction and all state (address, contract data) while consensus implements the proof-of-stake mechanism ensuring security and fault tolerance.
执行层提供执行引擎，处理用户交易和所有状态（地址、合约数据），而共识则实现权益证明机制，确保安全性和容错性。
3. The coordination mainly happens via regular calls which are scheduled in the PM repo. There are different kinds of developer calls with the biggest one being All Core Devs (ACD). This is where representatives of all involved teams come to discuss the current development of the consensus or execution layer.协调主要通过 PM 存储库中安排的定期调用进行。开发人员电话会议有多种类型，其中最大的一种是所有核心开发人员电话会议 (ACD)。所有相关团队的代表都在这里讨论共识层或执行层的当前发展。
4. Tried https://ethereum.org/zh/quizzes/, interesting :)

### 2024.4.5

> The Free Software movement is fundamental to Ethereum and all cryptocurrencies. The open, independent and collaborative development culture of Ethereum is strongly rooted in FOSS (Free and Open Source Software). Ethereum needs to be transparently implemented in software that gives full freedom to its users.
