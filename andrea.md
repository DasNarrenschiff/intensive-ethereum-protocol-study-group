A more recent example of practical secure
communication in today’s chat era is
the Signal protocol. Implemented in the
homonymous application, the Signal
protocol uses a form of public keys that
allow a seamless user experience for both
one-to-one and many-to-many (group
chat) conversations. The use of the Signal
protocol became the golden standard of
encrypted low-latency communication,
gaining adoption from other major
applications such as WhatsApp.
